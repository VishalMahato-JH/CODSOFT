# CODSOFT
Excited to share my progress on my first task as an intern at Codsoft! ðŸŽ‰ I developed a Java-based Number Game where users guess a random number (1-100) within 5 attempts. ðŸš€ The game provides feedback ("too high" or "too low"), supports multiple rounds, and calculates a score based on attempts taken.
